Age Distribution Histogram using Python

Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable (Age) using a **Histogram** in Python.  
It uses the **matplotlib** library to represent how ages are spread across different age groups in a population.

Objective:
- To understand data visualization using histograms
- To represent age distribution graphically
- To learn basic usage of the matplotlib library

Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Matplotlib library

Dataset Used:
The dataset consists of sample age values of individuals in a population:
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 22, 23, 24, 25, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 35, 40

Concept Used:
- Histogram
- Continuous variable visualization
- Data grouping using bins

How to Run the Program:
1. Install Python on your system
2. Install matplotlib 
3. Run the notebook:
